    <!-- 
        To build up a minimal list of operations to be performed on the DOM, 
        React needs to be able to compare what is currently in the DOM to what 
        should be there. To support this, the render function does not output 
        HTML or make changes to the DOM directly. Instead, it outputs a data 
        structure known as a Virtual DOM. This virtual version of the DOM is 
        greatly simplified and very fast to work with. React then checks the 
        virtual DOM against the real DOM in the browser and makes a list of 
        updates to perform. Since DOM manipulation is a slow process, this ensures 
        that only elements that have genuinely changed are updated. There are many 
        Virtual DOM based systems available in the JavaScript ecosystem, but React 
        is by far the most commonly used.
