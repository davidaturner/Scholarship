    <!-- AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. This technology helps to 
    load data from the server without refreshing the browser page. Ajax uses XHTML 
    for content, CSS for presentation, along with the DOM and JavaScript for 
    dynamic content display. Conventional web applications transmit information to 
    and from the server using simultaneous requests. It means that once you fill 
    out a form and have hit the submit button, you will be directed to a new page 
    with new information that has come from the server.

    With AJAX, when you hit submit, JavaScript will make a request to the server, 
    decipher the results, and then update the current screen. This process allows 
    the user to continue using the application while the client program requests 
    information from the server in the background. -->
    <h2>Using the XMLHttpRequest Object</h2>

    <div id="demo">
        <button type="button" onclick="loadXMLDoc()">Change Content</button>
    </div>

    <script>
        function loadXMLDoc() {
            var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
            xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
                if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
                this.responseText;
                }
        };
        xhttp.open("GET", "xmlhttp_info.txt", true);
        xhttp.send();
