// There is often confusion on what the difference is between undefined and 
// null. Undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been 
// assigned a value. Whereas null can be assigned to a variable to represent 
// 'no value'. Undefined and null are two different types as well: undefined 
// is a type itself, while null is an object.

// In JavaScript, unassigned variables are initialized with a default value 
// of undefined. JavaScript will never set a value to null, as this must be 
// entered programmatically.
