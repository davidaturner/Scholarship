        In HTML, you will use tags to define the structure of the document. A 
        tag is a specialized series of characters or a keyword that a browser 
        interprets as either the start or end of an HTML element. All tags have 
        a start, middle, and end. Now it's time for you to explore what the 
        paragraph tag would look like:
    -->
    <p>Here is a sentence. This is a very short paragraph.</p>
    <!-- 
        Elements are HTML components that contain the start tag, such as <p>, 
        the content of the paragraph, and the end tag, </p>. Think of elements 
        as the whole object, not just an individual tag.
