    <!-- The <img> tag is another tag that does NOT need a closing tag, just like 
    the <br> tag.

    When you want to display an image on an HTML page, you need to specify 
    exactly which image to display. To accomplish this, you need to add a 
    source attribute, "src", which is used in specifying the source of the 
    image or where the image is located on the page. Below, are the parts of 
    an img tag with a src attribute: -->
    
    <img src="./petshopboyx5.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
    <img src="https://woz-u.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/woz-thumbnail.jpg">
    <img src="./img/petshopboys4.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
</body>
