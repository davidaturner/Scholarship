    <!-- The paragraph <p> tag is used to wrap a block of text and format it as a 
    paragraph. This also allows the browser to know to automatically wrap the 
    text based on the window size. -->
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is another paragraph. There is vertical space that 
            separates the two paragraphs.</p>

    <!-- In the example above, you can see the paragraphs are separated by using 
    two different paragraph tags. What if you want this same break of lines, 
    but within one paragraph? Thats where the break tag <br> comes in.

    The <br> tag is a self-closing tag. This means it doesn't need a closing 
    tag, like the paragraph tag.  -->
        <p>This is paragraph. <br>This is more of the same paragraph on 
            another line.</p>

    <!-- The <div> element is used to create a generic container for content. It is 
    referred to as a structure element, because it is used to organize the 
    structure of a page. It is widely used throughout HTML documents. -->
        <div>Here is the first div element on the page.</div>
        <div>And here is the second div element.</div>
