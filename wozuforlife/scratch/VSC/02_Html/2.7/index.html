    <!-- The anchor tag <a> is how you add hyperlinks into the HTML page. The 
    <a> tag is similar to the image tag in one main way: you need to add 
    an attribute to the tag to tell it where you want the link to go. It 
    does not, however, use the src attribute to accomplish this. It uses 
    the href attribute, which will specify the URL of the page you wish to 
    link to. The last part of the anchor tag is the text between the opening 
    and closing tags. This text is what the user sees when the HTML is 
    rendered. Keep in mind, this tag DOES need a closing anchor tag </a>. 
    Consider the following code: -->
    <a href="http://www.google.com">Google Something!</a>

    <!-- If you want the web page to open in a new, separate tab or window, you 
    can add the target attribute to the <a> tag and set its value to "_blank". 
    The code below is what you need if you want the user to go to another 
    website, but not leave the page they are in: -->
    <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google Something!</a>

    <!-- The <a> tag is called an anchor tag because, originally, it was not meant 
    to jump between pages; it was meant to jump to a different location on the 
    same web page â€” an anchored location. -->
