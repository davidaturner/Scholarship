<p>David A. Turner, a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University, first 
started as an electrical engineer working on annunciator panel designs for 
Westinghouse. He then moved into IT writing device drivers and testing small 
C++ apps for Formtek Lockheed-Martin. Mr. Turner then spent more than a 
decade programming and maintaining Java backend programs for Blue Cross of 
Western Pennsylvania and, after 15 years, had realized that knowing a couple 
software languages was not enough in keeping up a competitive edge in today's 
job market. Desiring to learn a great set of computer skills, he enrolled in 
Codercamp/Woz-U!</p>
