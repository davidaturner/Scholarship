    <!-- Below is a list of the position values and whether they rely on the top, 
    right, bottom, and left properties.

    static - This value doesn't position the content in any unique way. It is 
    positioned in comparison to the normal flow of the page. The top, right, 
    bottom, and left properties will not affect this value.

    relative - This value positions the element according to the normal flow of 
    the document but then offsets. It's relative to itself based on the values of 
    top, right, bottom, and left properties.

    fixed - This value removes the element from the normal flow of the document. 
    It is positioned relative to the screen's viewport and doesn't move when 
    scrolled. Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, 
    and left.

    absolute - This value removes the element from the normal flow of the document. 
    This allows the positioning of the elements based on the browser window vs. 
    other elements. Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, 
    bottom, and left.  -->
