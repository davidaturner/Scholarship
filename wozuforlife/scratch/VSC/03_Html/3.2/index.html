<!--     
    Semantic tags are tags that clearly define what that element is for/doing, 
    these tags give more meaning to the browser and the developer in question. 
    An example of non-semantic tags could be a <div> or <span> element that 
    tells you nothing about what the content inside the tags are doing. A 
    semantic tag would be <section> that clearly defines a section of the page. 
    By just looking at the tag, you know what it will be doing. Throughout 
    this lesson, you will explore different semantic tags that give you some 
    understanding of the content at hand.
