// The .NET Framework includes classes, interfaces, and value types that expedite and 
// optimize the development process and provide access to system functionality.

// The .NET Framework types are the foundation upon which .NET applications, components, 
// and controls are built. This includes types that perform the following functions:

//     Represent base data types and exceptions.
//     Encapsulate data structures.
//     Perform I/O.
//     Access information about loaded types.
//     Invoke .NET Framework security checks.
//     Provide data access, rich client-side GUI, and server-controlled, client-side GUI.

// The .NET Framework provides a set of interfaces, as well as abstract and 
// concrete (non-abstract) classes. You can use the concrete classes as is or, in 
// many cases, derive classes from them. To use the functionality of an interface, 
// you can either create a class that implements the interface or derive a class from 
// one of the .NET Framework classes that implement the interface.

// The System namespace is the root namespace for fundamental types in the .NET 
// Framework. This namespace includes classes that represent the base data types used 
// by all applications.
