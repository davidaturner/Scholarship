3. (Describe your) Approach

Describe how to attack the problem.
Recursive approach? Iterative approach? Maybe, data structures and related algos.
Read the interviewer. If they look puzzled, you selected the wrong path.
Play as the interviewer a little bit. Ask many questions.
Do not write on the board.
Reveal your thinking and thought process.

/*
Think, before you start to Code. Leave the pen alone.
Establish a conversation, keep it going.
Verbalize what's in your mind.
Learn to relax/watch your interviewer.
Stay calm.
The problem might be tricked out.
