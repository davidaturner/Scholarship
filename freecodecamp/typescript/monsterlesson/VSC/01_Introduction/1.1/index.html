        Why Typescript is better?
        1. Detect errors sooner. More strongly typed than javascript, you 
        see less errors BEFORE runtime.
        2. Better for scaling. Difficult to scale because you cannot 
        create data types or entities. Easier to relay to customers and 
        stakeholders (ie. data types and properties)

        NOTE: If you use typescript create a tsconfig.json
        
        Why is TypeScript not good?
 
        One thing that many beginners do not understand about TypeScript 
        is that it does not guarantee type-correctness at runtime. Your 
        TypeScript code might be fully typed and the compiler assures 
        you that everything must be correctâ€¦ but at runtime you still 
        get errors because your variables might be of the wrong types!
