    <p>My laptop is unable to use create-react-app as of 20220820. I keep getting
        a ENONT error when I try running 'npm start'. It appears that the rscripts
        is looking for node_modules file of a directory %LOCALAPPDATA%. Made need
        to install node. There is no help online as far as I can see.
