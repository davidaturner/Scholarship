What is a Data Structure?
A data structure (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

The best programmers:
Fundamentally understand how and when to use the appropriate data structure
for the task they are trying to finish.

What is an abstract data type?
An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only
the interface to which a data structure must adhere to. The interface gives no details
of implementation and is independent of programming language.
