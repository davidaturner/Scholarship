Write with integrity.

Current writing lacks authenticity.
Pretentiousness.

Communicate brilliantly.
Not so much to impress.
Examine your motives using "fancy" words.
Confusing. Diluting. Amateurish.

Communicate precisely.

Example:
My client would regard it as eminently gratifying and propitious if you would deem it worthy of your time and resources to acquiesce graciously, in a fitting manner, to a confabulation in an environment considered conducive to both parties.

My solution:
My client would appreciate it if you would clarify a comment you made for the benefit of both parties.
