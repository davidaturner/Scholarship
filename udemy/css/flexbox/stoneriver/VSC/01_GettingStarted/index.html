        Useful tool: Modernizr
        Tells you what HTML, CSS and Javascript features the user browser's
        has to offer. 
        It’s a collection of superfast tests – or “detects” as we like to call them – 
        which run as your web page loads, then you can use the results to tailor 
        the experience to the user.
