		/*
		 * Walking through the problem.
		 * 
		 * 1. Listen
		 * Make sure you heard the question correctly Ask questions as needed.
		 * The optimal is not what YOU think it should be. It should instead be
		 * 		optimal to the problem given.
		 * Make sure your solution solves the ENTIRE problem and scenarios.
		 * 
		 * 2.Draw example(s).
		 * Use real numbers and strings.
		 * Make the example sufficiently large to suggest completeness.
		 * Do not use special cases as examples.
		 * 
		 * 3. State a brute force example.
		 * It's okay if it is terrible. Don't struggle for clever inital solutions.
		 * Discuss initial time and space complexities.
		 * 
		 * 4. Optimize
		 * Did you implement ALL the information? What is left to implement?
		 * Use a fresh example.
		 * Did you solve it incorrectly?
		 * Make time vs space tradeoff.
		 * Precompute information. Do helper/prep work.
		 * Use a hash table.
		 * Discuss best conceivable runtime.
		 * 
		 * 5. Walk through
		 * Don't dive into coding.
		 * Understand thoroughly the algorithm.
		 * Learn the difference between pseudocode and sloppy coding.
		 * 
		 * 6. Implement
		 * Modularized code.
		 * Error checks.
		 * Use classes/structs when appropriate.
		 * Good variable names. Not too long.
		 * If you get confused, do another walk throught and correct.
		 * 
		 * 7. Test
		 * Hand testing is too slow
		 * Start with conceptual test. like a code review.
		 * Double check weird looking code
		 * Double check hot spots 
		 * Test with small cases
		 * Test edges and special cases.
		 *
