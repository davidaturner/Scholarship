    <h1>David Anthony Turner</h1>
    <h3 style="color:indianred;">Why I chose to join the Freemote program</h3>
    <div id="container">
        <p><span class="first-letter">I</span> have been a software developer for 15+ years.
        I had always worked with the same technologies all that time. Creating and 
        maintaining billing systems for Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania using Java,
        Spring Beans, HTML, JS and JSP, I thought I had it made. 
        </p>
        <p><span class="first-letter">T</span>hat is, until around 2012. A number of 
        frameworks popped up from Google and Facebook and I broke an important rule: 
        <span style="color:indianred; font-style:italic;">Always keep learning</span>. I had 
        stopped learning, thinking that I would practice the same technologies for the length
        of my career. If I had only known better!
        </p>
        <p><span class="first-letter">A</span> company restructuring caused my boss 
        and many of my teammates to leave the company. I stayed but was unable 
        to adapt to the new faces and technologies pouring in as part of Blue 
        Cross of Western Pennsylvania spinoff into a for-profit subsidary, Highmark 
        Health Solutions. Eventually, my position was eliminated. So here I am. 
        Studying new technologies in preparation for that next job opportunity.
