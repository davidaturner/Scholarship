        <h1><span class="yellow">(David A.)</span> Turner - An Introduction</h1>
        <p><span>H</span>ello, my name is David A. Turner but I generally go by simply.. Turner. I am a software developer with over 15 years work experience. Java is my main language though I am working largely with C# these days because of the shorter learning curve in producing quality enterprise applications. Anyway, I am glad to be trying out your program. I hope it would help me address the following goals:</p>
        <h3 id="g1">Goal 1:</h3>
        <p><span class="first-letter">I</span> am almost 60 years old. And I have numerous co-morbidities. At the very least I would like to make some side income that can last me through retirement. Maybe I can work fulltime remotely? I <em>love</em> coding and I cannot imagine given a modicum of health that I would ever grow tired of it.</p>
        <h3 id="g2">Goal 2:</h3>
        <p><span class="first-class">I</span> have been languishing in Java hell for over 15 years thinking that my job working for the Man would be forever. Technology had exploded in 2010 and I'm afraid I haven't kept up. The last four years I have been refreshing my skills but without a basic strategy of what tech to learn I have wasted a lot of time.</p>
        <h3 id="g3">Goal 3:</h3>
        <p><span class="first-class">I</span> have been unemployed for the last 5 years. I even went back to school to prepare for a last ditch attempt at a career change into medical billing. Your program represents one of the last attempts I will take in salvaging my software development skill. Maybe I can be an independent contractor. </p>
